## Daily Generative Sketches by @liquidx.

Every day I make a sketch in code. It may reflect a mood, maybe an idea
or maybe just a refinement of a previous sketch. I aim to spend 30 mins
on each sketch, maximum an hour.

There's no higher purpose other than wanting to be able to create
something every day.
